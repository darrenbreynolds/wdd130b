            <p>I've been in the running community all my life, i've always loved running and pushing myslef to the limits, once i could i joined a cross country team adn then for 2 years I did track. 
                During my time as an athlete I learned how to take care of myself and push myself at the same so I wanted to share my knowlegde to those who may know nothing about running and don't know where to start.

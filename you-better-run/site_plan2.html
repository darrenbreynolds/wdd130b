        So, you're wanting to get better at running. Whether you're a professional, new to running, or somewhere in the middle there's always more to learn and more to do to get that much faster.

        Form
        When you run you need good form otherwise you’re not running to your full potential, good form looks like this, (image here) (below image) so why do you do all these things their so small, well from my experience these small changes have made a big impact, like running on the balls of your feet this simple change made my times decrease immensely and helped prevent many injuries like shin splints which is pain at the front of your lower leg and it sucks but when you run on the balls of your feet your chances of getting it lower immensely. 
        Why keep your head up? Well if you don’t keep your head up the rest of your form suffers, your shoulders cave in your breathing isn’t as good, and you simply just don’t run as good.
        Why do you lean a little bit? This is to help you keep moving, it gives your body the feeling  of falling and so your legs move faster. 
        Why keep hands relaxed? Well they need form but not to be fists, if they are tight your gonna be to tense and if you’re too relaxed your hands are gonna flail around and get in the way, pretend you have a potato chip in your hand and you're not trying to break it, that's how your hands should be. 
        This form is gonna be hard to perfect and you may never get it right but that's ok, with running it's a lifelong endeavor, cause if you stay healthy and keep trying even if it's just little runs you can always get better.

        how to prepare for a race
        The day before you should be drinking a ton of water, and the night before you should eat a lot of carbs. Get plenty of rest.
        The day of, if your race is in the morning, have an extremely light breakfast if in the afternoon keep it light but not crazy light. If your race is in the afternoon again light lunch, an hour before the race eat some kind of energy bar and then nothing else till the race is over, then stop drinking water 30-20 minutes before. Also make sure you use the restroom before the race as well. 
        Breathing If you want to good breathing do it through your nose and then out through your mouth research shows that breathing through your nose brings more oxygen and moisture,
        800 This race is gonna suck but you're gonna be pushing as hard as you can the entire time, when you hit the second lap think of it as another lap then give it your all in the last 150 meters.  
        Mile Get out hard for the first 200 then settle into your pace, mentally and physically go faster each lap cause this will help you get consistent times.
        5k During the race, get out hard don’t sprint but it should be pushing it, once like the first quarter mile is done you should start slowing down and then get into your pace, 
        After the race Get lots of water and don’t immediately sit down, if you do your body will get sore quickly and it will suck to get up, drink lots of water and do a cool down run, this should be at a relaxed pace and should be half a mile to a mile. Make sure to stretch as well.

    <p class="subf">Good form in running is essential when you run without good form you’re not running to your full potential, good form looks like this.</p>

        <img class= "running" src="styles/Screenshot-2024-11-09-121044.jpg" alt="running man with good form">
            <p class="label1">EYES UP</p>
            <p class="label2">LEAN FORWARD</p>
            <p class="label3">RELAXED HANDS</p>
            <p class="label4">RUNNING ON THE BALLS OF YOUR FEET</p>
    </div>
   <p> so why do you do all these things their so small, well from my experience these small changes have made a big impact, like running on the balls of your feet this simple change made my times decrease immensely and helped prevent many injuries like shin splints which is pain at the front of your lower leg and it sucks but when you run on the balls of your feet your chances of getting it lower immensely. 
    Why keep your head up? Well if you don’t keep your head up the rest of your form suffers, your shoulders cave in your breathing isn’t as good, and you simply just don’t run as good.
    Why do you lean a little bit? This is to help you keep moving, it gives your body the feeling  of falling and so your legs move faster. 
    Why keep hands relaxed? Well they need form but not to be fists, if they are tight your gonna be to tense and if you’re too relaxed your hands are gonna flail around and get in the way, pretend you have a potato chip in your hand and you're not trying to break it, that's how your hands should be. 
    This form is gonna be hard to perfect and you may never get it right but that's ok, with running it's a lifelong endeavor, cause if you stay healthy and keep trying even if it's just little runs you can always get better.

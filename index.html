I love being outside playing any kind of sport. <br> I may not be the best but Ill have fun trying. Im an uncle of 3. With this course im purely hear to learn i want to just take as much info as i can before i leave on my mission, plus this info from this class will be useful in the future.<br>Ive been a member all my life and i think my favorite quote is “think celestial” its just a beautiful and simple way to know what you need to be doing in this life.</P>
